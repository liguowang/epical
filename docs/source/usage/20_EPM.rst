EPM
=========

Description
------------

1. EPM is a modeling tool, not a epigenetic clock. It can be used to model any phenotypes 
   including aging.
2. In contrast to regression bases methods, the EPM does not assume a linear relationship 
   between the epigenetic state and a trait of interest.
3. In contrast to other clocks within this package, the EPM algorithm does NOT come 
   with pre-selected CpGs and pre-calculated coefficients. Instead, users are required
   to provide training data to build the model. In essence, EPM performs CpG selection,
   model fitting, and prediction simultaneously. For more technical details, refer 
   to the `EPM toturial <https://epigeneticpacemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/epm_tutorial/>`_.
4. The ``epical EPM`` command need two input files: the first being the beta value spreadsheet, 
   and the second being the meta-information file that specifies the training and test samples 
   (see the example below).

Example
---------

Prepare the meta-information file. In this instance, the 80 samples were shuffled, 
and subsequently, 60 (75%) samples were chosen as "training" samples, while the 
remaining 20 (25%) samples were designated as "testing" samples.

.. Note::
   The meta-information file must have two columns named as "Age" and "Designation".
