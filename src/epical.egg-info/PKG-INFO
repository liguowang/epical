Installation
=============

*Epical* is coded in Python. It needs Python 3 (version 3.5.x) or a later
version for installation and execution.

Prerequisites
--------------

- `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
- `pip3 <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_
- `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_
- `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ (Only requires by *AltumAge*)

.. note::
   `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ is not included as a Python
   Dependency (refer to the section below) due to its substantial size and
   occasional need for specialized installation procedures. Please follow
   its provided `installation instruction <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_
   . Failure to install `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ will result
   in the unavailability of the *AltumAge* command. If you opted for a Python
   virtual environment to install TensorFlow, it is recommend to install
   *Epical* within the same virtual environment.


Python Dependencies
--------------------

- `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
- `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
- `sklearn <https://www.scilearn.com/>`_
- `bx-python <https://github.com/bxlab/bx-python>`_
- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
- `EpigeneticPacemaker <https://epigeneticpacemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

.. note::
   Users do NOT need to install these packages manually, as they will be
   automatically installed if you use
   `pip3 <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.

Install Epical
--------------
::
